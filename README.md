# Date it

  A minimal, full modular and accesible to do app, based on a *post*, *rating* and *archive* system. You can find any post with just 2 **clicks!**

## How the system works?

  People can leave *posts* (eg. Bug ticket) and other people can comment to help to fix the bug.
  Then, the owner of the post can mark the comment's as "favorites" and when the *post* is *archived*, the post will be saved only with the comments that were usefull for solving the problem. (If you don't want to loose any of them, this can be configured!)
